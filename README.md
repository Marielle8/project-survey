# Survey form with React

This is a project I made during the Technigo bootcamp.

This project was about building a survey form. The purpose of this project was to learn  how to use the useState hook in react and how to connect HTML form inputs to state.

## The problem

I started by creating a board in Trello to plan the project. After that I created the components I wanted to have in my project. I started to create them in codesandbox and the reason for that was so I could practise a bit first and see that I had understood everything about components and how they work. When I started the project in Visual Studio I had a lot of problems with node_modules so my biggest challenge whit this project was to follow my timeplan. I had some difficulties with passing the right information down to my components through props but I searched a lot on github and stackOverflow to see other peoples solutions and that helped me a lot. I did 2 validation tests: validator.w3.org and color contrast accessibility validator. The site passed both of them. I also added tabindex for screenreaders. If I had more time I would create another button in the summary that will take you back to the form again. I would also style the radio buttons and the text inputs in a nicer way.
